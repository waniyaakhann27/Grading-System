Objective:A simple Python program for teachers to grade students easily. It asks yes/no questions about submitted certificates (Vidyarthi, Great Learning, HackerRank 5-star, four extra certs) and the 35 Codes Assignment. Each yes gives 1 point (max 8). Finally, it shows the total score and grade (A+, A, B, etc.). (49 words)

Scope and Requirements of the Project
Project Scope
A simple, interactive Python program that helps teachers or evaluators quickly check whether a student has submitted all required certificates and assignments, calculate a score out of 8 points, and display the final score with a meaningful grade.
Functional Requirements
Accept student name (optional).
Ask 8 yes/no questions one by one about:
Vidyarthi certificate
Great Learning certificate
HackerRank 5-star proof
Four extra certificates (Python Basic, Problem Solving Basic, Problem Solving Intermediate, Python Foundation Test)
35 Codes Assignment
Give 1 point for each “yes” answer (maximum 8 points).
Show total score and assign a grade (A+, A, B+, B, C, or Incomplete).
Display clear feedback after each answer and a final summary.
Non-Functional Requirements
Easy to use – simple text questions, no complex input needed.
Fast – completes grading in under 1 minute.
Accurate – correctly counts points and shows results every time.
Reliable – works on any computer with Python installed.
Clear and readable output with proper formatting.
Lightweight – no external files or internet required.
Portable – single Python file that can be shared and run anywhere.
Technical Expectations
Written in Python 3 (no external libraries required).
Single, clean, well-commented .py file (easy to read and modify).
Uses only built-in Python features (input(), print(), basic data types).
Object-oriented design with a clear StudentGrader class (optional but preferred).
Proper indentation, meaningful variable names, and functions/methods for reusability.
Input validation: accepts “yes/y” or “no/n” (case-insensitive), rejects invalid entries.
Clear, formatted console output with separators and symbols (✓ / ✗).
Handles multiple students in one run if needed (easy to extend).
Runs on Windows, macOS, or Linux without installation.
No dependencies – works with standard Python installation only.
